// Objective: write a function to compute the first 'n' numbers in the fibonacci sequence

/*
 * The fibonacci sequence is found by summing the current number and previous number in the sequence.
 * For example:	0 + 1 = 1
 *							1 + 1 = 2
 *							1 + 2 = 3
 *							2 + 3 = 5
 *							3 + 5 = 8
 *							5 + 8 = 13
 *							8 + 13 = 21
 *							etc.
