MEAN Course Exercises
=====================

Exercises for the MEAN January 2015 Course.

## Introduction ##

Two of the quickest ways to get good at coding are experience and feedback.

These exercises aim to help you fulfill these goals. As you go along in the course and learn more, you will be given exercises to help reinforce the concepts that you are learning in class. You will need to be able to do the following to be successful in these exercises:

1. Use git/GitHub, either through the [CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), WebStorm, or [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) GUI.
2. Understand design specs and write code to achieve them.
3. Use the appropriate tools to run and test your code.
	- Initially, you will be writing vanilla JavaScript and can use a NodeJS Run Configuration in WebStorm, or just the Chrome Console.
	- As the course gets more challenging, you will have to use CLI tools like `grunt` and `nodemon` to run/test your app.

## Setup Instructions ##

To get started with your exercises, first make sure that you have a free GitHub account and that you are signed in. Then,

* Fork this repo (Fork == copy it) by pressing the 'Fork' button in the upper right.
* Copy the 'HTTPS clone URL' by pressing the button on the lower right. The repo URL should now be on your clipboard. It should be something like: `https://github.com/<your username>/mean-exercises.git`.
* Go to your terminal, navigate to your development directory* and clone your repo by typing `git clone <paste the repo URL here>`.
	- On a Mac you can paste into the terminal by pressing <kbd>command</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd>
* This will create a folder called `mean-exercises`. You can go into the folder by typing `cd mean-exercises`.
* You can now open this project by:
	- Opening WebStorm, and selecting `File > New Project from Existing Files`.
	- Select 'Source files are in a local directory, no Web server is yet configured'.
	- Navigate to the `mean-exercises` directory and mark it as Project Root. (the WS icon)
	- Click finish.
* Make sure to create a folder for each new exercise.

**Note*: Your development directory can be anywhere you want -- Documents, Desktop, etc. Just create a folder so you can organize all of your dev stuff in one place.

## How to Submit ##

You will submit your code to be reviewed by committing your changes through git, and then pushing to your own repo that you forked. Your code will be code reviewed to give you the necessary feedback so that you can learn best practices.
